# Lasair

Preparing to use the Lasair Alert Broker [(Smith et al. 2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019RNAAS...3...26S/abstract) for technosignature projects.

- Finding Alerts in the ETZ (and other transit zones?)
- Looking for particularly unusual events from stars
- Dissapearing star candidates
- SETI Ellipsoid and time+space based alerts?
